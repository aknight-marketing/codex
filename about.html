          <h1>Stop competing. Start differentiating.</h1>
          <p>
            Most startups can’t tell customers the product is built. They fall between
            “who are you?” and “why should I care?”.
          </p>

            I’m Alex, and I help startups find their voice, sharpen their value, and grow fast
            with traction.

          <h3>Sharpen your positioning</h3>

            I work with early-stage and scale-ups to clarify who you serve, why you’re
            different, and how to position for growth.

          <h3>Build lean, scalable marketing systems</h3>

            into a revenue function.

        But more importantly — I help founders stop chasing and start leading. Because when
        marketing isn’t about complexity, it’s about creating the content that makes
        competition irrelevant.

        <div>
          <h3>Corporate Past</h3>
          <p>
            I wasn't always this clear. Years ago, I worked at a large corporation. I clocked
            in every morning with my ID #333393. No name. No identity. Just a number. I worked
            hard, delivered results, and demanded nothing in return.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>The Turning Point</h3>
          <p>
            That is the moment I didn't want to be a cog. I moved into startups — where your
            ideas matter, and where clarity wins.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Making an Impact</h3>
          <p>
            Since then, I’ve helped make ecommerce supply chains more sustainable, executed
            wins in global retail marketing teams, and supported manufacturing SaaS — the hub
            of the UK economy — to digitize and grow.

      </div>
      <p class="section-note">But here's what I’ve learned:</p>
      <p class="section-note">
        You can’t just build a great product and expect people to care. You need sharp
        messaging, scalable execution, and marketing that’s tied to revenue, not vanity.

        What makes my approach different? I combine thoughtful research and a sharp creative
